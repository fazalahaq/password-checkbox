Create a text box to enter user password and a checkbox to show/hide password. 

The checkbox will be unchecked by default and the password should be encrypted.

The checkbox when checked would show the user password as plain text. When unchecked, it would make the password encrypted.

Use JQuery for implementation and CSS for designing.
